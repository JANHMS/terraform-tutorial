`Terraform`  is fun to use and highly in demand.
This is due to the fact that it makes it much easier to build software architecture. 

-> This tutorial how much faster it is to set up an EC2 instance with `Terraform` instead of setting it up by clicking around in the AWS GUI. 

## Before you start
1. `aws configure` 
2. Paste in your aws credentials (you can create a new IAM admin user)
3. `cd learn-terraform-aws-instance/`


## How to run
1. `terraform init` 
2. `terraform plan` (optional)
3. `terraform apply` (type yes) 

Finally changes are visible in AWS, and output in the terminal.

4. `terraform destroy`
